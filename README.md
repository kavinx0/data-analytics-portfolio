# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data analytics projects demonstrating practical skills in **SQL**, **Python**, and analytical problem-solving using real-world style datasets.

The projects focus on answering meaningful business questions, analysing trends and behaviour, and communicating insights clearly through structured analysis and documentation.


## 🎯 Portfolio Objectives

This portfolio is designed to:
- Demonstrate industry-standard data analytics workflows
- Showcase analytical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Apply SQL and Python to real-world style datasets
- Communicate insights clearly for technical and non-technical audiences
- Build a strong foundation for entry-level data analytics roles


## 📁 Projects

### 01. Customer Purchase & Retention Analysis ([view project](./01_Customer_Analysis)) (in progress)
Analysis of customer transaction data to understand revenue trends, repeat purchasing behaviour, and customer retention patterns.

**Key focus areas:**
- Revenue and sales trends over time
- Repeat vs one-time customer behaviour
- High-value customers and products

**Tools & Technologies:**
- SQL (joins, aggregations, window functions)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### 02. Funnel & Cohort Analysis (in progress)
Analysis of user journeys and conversion funnels, including cohort-based retention analysis to understand behavioural patterns over time.

**Key focus areas:**
- Funnel drop-off and conversion rates
- Cohort-based retention analysis
- Behavioural trends across user segments

**Tools & Technologies:**
- SQL (event-based analysis, window functions)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### 03. Data Quality & Validation (in progress)
Exploration of data quality and validation techniques to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and anomalies in analytical datasets.

**Key focus areas:**
- Data profiling and completeness checks
- Detection of anomalies and outliers
- Validation of business rules and assumptions
- Improving reliability of analytical outputs

**Tools & Technologies:**
- SQL (data validation queries)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### 04. Executive KPI & Revenue Performance Analysis (in progress)

**Key Focus Areas**

- Executive-level revenue KPIs and performance metrics
- Revenue trends and growth patterns over time
- Revenue concentration and dependency analysis (e.g. top customers/products)
- Repeat customer contribution and retention indicators
- Identification of key business risks and opportunities
- Clear, decision-oriented insights and recommendations

**Tools & Technologies**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQL (aggregations, grouping, KPI calculations)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib (lightweight, explanatory visualisations)

## 🛠 Core Skills Demonstrated

Across the projects in this portfolio, the following skills are demonstrated:

- Data extraction and transformation using SQL  
- Exploratory data analysis using Python  
- Analytical thinking and problem decomposition  
- Data quality awareness and validation  
- Clear communication of insights and findings  
- Structured documentation and reproducible analysis  


## 📂 Repository Structure

Each project folder follows a consistent structure:
- `README.md` — project overview and objectives  
- SQL scripts — queries used for analysis  
- Jupyter notebooks — exploratory analysis and visualisation  
- Supporting files — data descriptions and written insights  

This structure reflects common industry practices and ensures clarity and reproducibility.


## 📌 Notes

- Projects are built incrementally and reflect ongoing learning and skill development.
- Datasets used are either publicly available or representative of real-world analytical scenarios.
- The emphasis is on correctness, clarity, and analytical reasoning rather than dashboard-heavy presentation.
- Right now project 1 has been completed, 2 and 3 are partially completed but yet to commit and 4 is still underway
